## WHAT IS HIGHRISE IDEAS?
Highrise Ideas is our **crowdfunding platform**. Creatives on Highrise have no shortage of impressive item concepts, but like many artists, often need a bit of support to bring their unique visions to life. Highrise Ideas empowers the community to come together to forge a dream into reality. 🤝

Similar to most crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter or IndyGoGo, Highrise Ideas is a tool to help artists share concepts for single wearable avatar items they’d love to make, and helps members of the community explore a library of designs they’d love to wear. 

Once you see an Idea that resonates with you, you can commit to supporting that item by **Preordering** it. 

🔖 Preordering works just like pledging or backing a project in Kickstarter: if the item gets enough support to meet its funding goal, it gets created, and all backers receive the item. If it doesn’t meet its funding goal, the Idea is cancelled and preorders are refunded. 

As the Highrise Ideas feature is still in its embryonic stage, we’re eager to hear your thoughts on what changes might best serve our creative community in future updates! The keys to _any_ idea becoming a reality are both adaptability and perseverance to keep improving, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do. 💪

So let’s go! Share a concept for a single item, and get ready to rally around designs that get people buzzing. After all, every great look starts with an Idea. 💭


### FUNDING PIPELINE

For an item to be released through Highrise Ideas, it will need to pass through three stages: 

🔎 **Review Phase**, in which Highrise Staff assesses eligible Ideas and approves valid designs

💸 **Funding Phase**, a 30 day period for the item to receive public funding from the Highrise community

🏗️ **Production Phase**, a 14+ day period for the HR Art Team to create the item.

Ideas can be approved or rejected by staff during the 🔎 **Review Phase** for a few different reasons. [Check out our item eligibility guidelines here!](https://create.highrise.game/learn/designer-resources/ideas/guidelines) 

During the 💸 **Funding Phase**, anyone who wants to support the Idea can do so by preordering the item for a 50% discount. Once an Idea reaches its Funding Goal, the item **immediately** enters a its Production Phase. 

During the 🏗️ **Production Phase**, anyone may continue to preorder the item for full price. _Production Phases are guaranteed to last a minimum of 14 days._ This ensures that anyone who missed the initial preordering window have a chance to buy it, and gives creators a longer runway to keep earning! 
After Production concludes, the item will be distributed to backers automatically, and the item Designer will receive 10% of the total revenue in the form of Earned Gold. 

Items created through HR Ideas are _only purchasable_ during the Funding and Production Phases! After that, they may be traded, but are no longer available through Ideas or any other Highrise Shop.
