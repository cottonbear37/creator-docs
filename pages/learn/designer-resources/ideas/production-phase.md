### PRODUCTION PHASE

⚠️ **_October 23 UPDATE: We've made some changes to this process! Please read on to learn about the new timelines for Ideas Production Phase scheduling. Thank you!_**

The Production Phase is when all the magic happens! During this phase, the Highrise Art Team communicates with the the Idea Designer to create the funded item. 

Once your Idea has been fully funded, you’ll receive a message from our team to invite you to a 1-1 conversation with our staff artists. You can use this chat to share additional references, special notes, and review a sneak peek of your item before it goes live! 

The Production Phase is your opportunity to exercise creative control and bring your vision to life exactly as you imagine it. We'll inform you of technical limitations and potential workarounds regarding layering and rendering issues, but will do our best to see your Idea through as you intend.

##### Production Phases last a minimum of two weeks to allow for continued Preorders.

**Throughout this phase, anyone may continue to preorder the item, in any amount, at full price.** This is the last time the item will be available for broad public purchase - after the item is released, it will only be available via trade. The two-week minimum Production Timeline will ensure that anyone who wants the item has a chance to buy it; and in tandem, it ensures you get a bigger payout!
