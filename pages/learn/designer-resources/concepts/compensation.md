# Designer Compensation

All Concept-winning designers are paid for their work according to two different systems: Standard Item Compensation and and Performance Item Compensation. 
Designers receive 6 copies of all items produced. Compensation is split evenly between collaborating duos.

⚠️ *_This system is in its Trial Phase for 2024's Quarter 3! Please stay tuned for updates._* ⚠️


## Standard Item Compensation

👉 If your item is released in Daily Rewards, the Holiday Shop, a Bubbles grab, or as a free gift, you'll get paid on a tiered scale. 
The more items you release during the quarter, the more you'll start earning per item. 

#### Tier 1
**10,000** Earned Gold for your first item

#### Tier 2
**15,000** Earned Gold per Item for your second through fifth items

#### Tier 3
**25,000** Earned Gold per Item for your sixth through twentieth items

#### Tier 4
**50,000** Earned Gold per Item for your twenty-first through fiftieth items

#### Tier 5
**100,000** Earned Gold per Item for items released past 50+ count


** **

📅 Item counts are reset each quarter! Your count is determined by the date that your item is released in game, not the date that you win a given Concept. 


## Performance Item Compensation


For items released in Grabs, Event Rewards, or item-only Sales, you'll earn a percentage of the total revenue generated in that release. 

#### 🍄FOR GRABS🍄

All revenue is calculated by total gold spent after the grab ends. Grabs typically run for about a month. 

#### ⭐FOR EVENT REWARDS⭐
Event revenue is calculated by adding together the total gold spent on event-related consumables. This includes purchases of Energy, Guaranteed Success Multipliers, and Rocket Fuel. 

#### 💰FOR SALES💰
If your design appears in an item-only sale for cash, you'll receive a percentage of the net revenue from that sale. 
Should your item be featured in a sale that includes additonal gold, collectibles, consumables, or bonus spin tokens, we consider your item a Standard Release that will count toward your tiered base compensation. 

### 💸 Payouts Per Item

Performance Items Compensation is determined on a per-item basis.  
Typically, you can expect an item to generate less than $4,200 USD.  If your item is part of a release that performs about average, you'll make 3.5% of net revenue.

If your item outperforms our baseline, you'll get bumped up to 15% of net revenue per item. 

#### 🔄 To account for the Earned Gold to Cash conversion tax, all Performance Item payouts include an additional stipend to cover the withdrawal fee. 
This means that whenever you do cash out your Earned Gold, you'll receive the full 3.5% in cash in your bank account. 

***Baseline Percentage Payout Per Performance Item***
3.5% of revenue (8.75% of gold) for items earning <$4,200 (12.6M Gold)

***Bonus Percentage Payout Per Exceptional Performance Item***
15% of revenue (37.5% of gold) for items earning ≥$4,200 (12.6M Gold)

#### 📅 As event & grab item payouts depend on total revenue, your compensation will be sent to you after the release is officially over. This can be anywhere from a week to a month past its launch date.
