# Designer Compensation

All Concept-winning designers are compensated for their designs by a rarity-based tier system.

🔹 Rare: 50,000 Earned Gold

🔮 Epic: 70,000 Earned Gold

⭐ Legendary: 100,000 Earned Gold

🌈 Mythical: 150,000 Earned Gold


**_Earned Gold_** can be redeemed for cash! Find the [Creator Exchange here](https://create.highrise.game/dashboard/finances/creator-exchange) to set up an account with Tipalti and cash out your Earned Gold.  



## Bonus Items 

Designers receive one Account-Bound copy of their item as a keepsake. As this copy is untradable, you'll always have access to it as long as you're on Highrise! 

Alongside your Account-Bound copy, you'll also receive a variable amount of tradable bonus items based on a tiered scaling system. The tiers are determined by the item's Rarity as follows: 

**Rares: 6 tradable copies**

**Epics: 4 tradable copies**

**Legendaries: 2 tradable copies**

**Mythicals: 2 tradable copies**

These variable bonus items reflect our efforts to be cognizant of the impact that high item emission rates may have on our in-game economy.

## Special Circumstances

On occasion, the Highrise Art Team will collaborate with individual artists to create non-concept content for various events and sales. Compensation for such one-off creations usually involve custom payouts and prizes. 

We'll communicate with you the rates we'll be using prior to your item's debut. Unless otherwise stated, we'll default to the rates described above for most special circumstances.
