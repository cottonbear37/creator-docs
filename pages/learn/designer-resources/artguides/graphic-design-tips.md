# Graphic Design Tips


I'd like you all to take a look at the 'rule of the thirds' and 'grids'

üö© lets do a post layout:

‚ñ´Ô∏è when creating a post, you should create a basic grid. just some margins to put your info in is enough.
usually there are 3 main infos that you want to show. the items name, the items picture, and your @/ signature. sometimes a secondary title as well.

‚ñ´Ô∏è Notice that when I put the info too close to the edges, its like it's shy, and wants to run away! So I created some margins, and put my info inside it. now its more centered,  your eyes see it immediately, and it seem more important.

theres a focus to the information that wasn‚Äôt there before.

2. Many users like to use a frame. in this case:
    - You should create a margin inside the frame, so the info is not glued to the frame as well.
    I also find that when the character breakes the frame, it looks super interesting and the contents of the image dont look too confined, like the character is breaking the posts borders and coming out of it. it almost looks 3d.

3. lets talk hierarchy:
    - Notice that the bigger and more complex font I use is just for the title. Because the item name is the most important written information here to me.
    The other info is smaller and in neutral fonts because their importance is secondary. Avoid mixing different and complex fonts. 1 complex font and neutral ones go well together.
    - I used an elegant font to promote elegant glasses. If I was promoting a cute kawaii item, I'd use a more bubbly cute font.
    - Nothing is set in stone! I broke the margins with that little cloud I used to highlight 'fits avatar head'. Its touching the frame, its crossing my imaginary margin, and is even touching the avatar and my signature. As long as its not distracting, its fine. You can always break your own rules as long as its still working.

1. I have a lot of negative space here. do I need to fill it with something? NO!
    - I chose a more elegant approach here, so leaving it empty also conveys that elegance and minimalism.
    - BUT YOU CAN FILL IT UP theres no design police here! I could use this space to put a highlight of my item, tho I personally prefer it empty.

2. composition and styling:
    - If this is the promo art for glasses, why do I need to show any of the pants and hand items?
    why indeed. Here I decided to give all focus to hte avatars face. I removed the bag strap from the image bc its unnecessary info. but I chose to leave the earrings and necklace bc i though they were stylish and are composing the overall look.
    - I posed the character a little bit to give the image some movement.
    - Since I had no space for the title anymore, I chose that big dark (empty of information) space the hair formed and put the title there in white for contrast.
    - Since I have less negative space now, I decided to remove the little cloud.
    - I recolored the 'fits avatar head' and my signature using colors that were already in the image, for extra cohesion
    - I made my signature lighter so it looks like its taking less space. now that i have less space.
    - I also opted for a simple make up, no piercings, and a nude color of lipstick so the glasses stand out
    - even tho the hair is covering the frame, I'm still respecting the margins I created
    - notice that the glasses, the main point of the image, are near the center of the image, where the most important info should be

this leave a cue for:

1. Rule of the thirds:
where do the eyes want to look first when you look at an image?
    - when you divide your image in 3 parts vertical and horizontal, where these lines meet are the  points in the image where your eyes will want to look first.  thats why we dont want important stuff too far away from those. in this case, i put the glasses there

notice I put the glasses in the middle of those points

another approach for earrings

- posed the characters head in a cute pose
- styled the character in a more sexy tone (wink, parted lips, contour)
- chose a hair that doesn't cover the left earring, so its in evidence.
- put the earrings in the thirds encounters
- chose a more romantic font.
- the name makes it so that its unmistakable what the item is
- changed the shirt, since the loops get too close to the shirt, the stripes of the other shirt would be very distracting.
- since the loops are light, I chose dark hair to frame it
- left a little bit of white in the back ground for al ittle bit of empty space (feels less crowded, less claustrophobic)

1. take away:
    - I know all we want is to design cute items and wear and have others wear and love them, but you also want it to SELL.
    - You want your item to be funded, your concepts to win contests. so you need to be able to show them off ! Thats why we have so many ads everywhere, Because showing it off in the right way makes a huge difference. 
    So take a little bit of time to work on the promo art.
    - Make the item look special, expensive, make people want it. Sell not just the item, but the overall look. Make people think that their outfit is not complete without your item. But also make sure people understand what the item is.
    - Work with contrast, proportion, rule of the thirds and grids/margins. you can break the rules as long as the message still works, but braking the rules is harder than following them. So if you're not sure how to break them in a nice way, its ok to choose the safest path, because it will work.
    - Dress the avatar with things that will elevate your item, not distract viewers from them.
