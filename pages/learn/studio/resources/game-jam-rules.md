# Game Jam Rules

Game jams are structured creative challenges designed to inspire developers, encourage collaboration, and promote innovation through themed world creation. Participants compete for rewards by building interactive, high-quality worlds within a set time frame.

Below are the official rules for participating in any Highrise game jam.

## Entry Submissions

- Worlds must be created **after the game jam announcement**. Pre-existing worlds will be disqualified.
- Submissions must include the **official game jam tag** provided in the announcement. Tags should be entered without the `#` symbol.
- You may not submit a world that was created by someone else, purchased, or reused from prior events.
- Selling or purchasing worlds for game jam purposes is strictly prohibited and may result in disqualification.
- Submissions must align with the official game jam **theme**.
- Template-based or low-effort worlds will not be accepted. Entries must show originality, functionality, and creative intent.

## Judging and Rewards

- Submissions will be locked during the **judging period**. You may not edit your world once judging begins.
- Worlds are judged based on:
  - Overall quality
  - Creativity and use of the theme
  - Social design and multiplayer interaction
- A **tiered reward structure** applies:
  - First Place: 150,000 Gold or a Unique Pet
  - Second Place: 75,000 Gold
  - Third Place: 50,000 Gold
- Gold rewards are issued to the world owner, who may distribute the prize among collaborators at their discretion.
- A **participation reward** is available to creators who submit a fully functional, high-effort world that meets theme and quality standards.
- Incomplete, unpolished, or off-theme entries will not be eligible for any rewards.

## Timeline

- These dates are outlined in each individual jam announcement.

## Collaboration
