# Game Jam Rules

Game jams are meant to be fun, push your limits, enhance your experience, and provide opportunities to collaborate and compete with others. Below are the rules that must be followed when participating in a game jam:

### Entry Submissions:

- When submitting an entry, the world must be created after the game jam announcement. Any world created before the announcement will be rejected.
- Entries must be submitted with the unique game jam tag. This can be checked in Studio upon upload, and the tag can be found in the announcement.
- When adding tags, do not include the "#" symbol, as it gets filtered out.
- You may not submit a world that does not belong to you, was made by someone else, or was purchased.
- Purchasing or selling worlds related to the game jam is prohibited and will result in penalties.
- When participating, all entries must adhere to the game jam theme.
- Unmodified worlds or basic templates with minimal effort will be rejected. Simply adding a few assets to a world does not qualify as a valid entry.

### Entries and Rewards:

- For each game jam, you can track your entry status through the sheet provided in the announcement:
    - **Under Review:** Your world is still being reviewed.
    - **Approved:** Your entry has been approved, and rewards will be sent to you shortly.
    - **Rejected:** Your entry has been rejected, and the reason will be mentioned in the notes. (You can appeal on Discord.)
- If your world was approved and the **"rewarded"** status is set to **true** but you have not received your rewards, please revisit support and be patient.
- Rewards are sent within **48 hours** after approval. Please be patient as we verify users and distribute rewards.
- If your entry was rejected for submitting a purchased world, you are **ineligible** to submit a new entry.

### Deadlines:

- After the submission deadline, you may not submit a new entry.
- If your world was rejected, you can still make changes and resubmit it until the winner announcement day.
- You may update or modify your world before the announcement day.
- Goals will still count even after the submission deadline.
- If your world was rejected and you did not appeal before the deadline, your entry will no longer be approved.
- If you have an existing support ticket and the game jam ends, you still have a chance to appeal.

### Collaboration:

- Collaborations are reviewed after the submission deadline.
- You may collaborate with only **one** player, and the collaboration must be submitted through the form.
- You must specify each player's contributions in detail.
- Minimal effort does not count as collaboration. This includes actions such as uploading a world for someone, finding assets, or adding MP3 files or images. Collaboration must be **genuine**.
- Collaborator rewards may be delayed as we review the collaboration.

### Goals:

- If the game jam includes a goal, it will have a deadline. After the deadline, goal tracking will stop.
- Only entries with the official game jam tag are eligible for goal rewards.
- Goal rewards will be sent on the last day of the goal deadline.
- If your entry was rejected, you are **ineligible** to participate in the goals unless you submit a new entry or successfully appeal for another review.

### Categories and Winners:

- Each game jam will have the following categories:
    - **Best Overall Experience:** Scores top marks in all categories listed below.
    - **Best Scripting:** A world built with scripting, free of bugs, and providing a smooth experience.
    - **Best Interactive Elements:** Awarded to worlds with the most interactive features, including UI elements.
    - **Best Creative Design:** Recognizes either original art or a well-designed world, whether using paid assets or handmade elements.
    - The fifth category is dynamic and will be based on the game jam theme, as specified in the announcement.
- Winners will be **announced** at the end of the game jam.
- Rewards will be sent afterward once they are fully prepared.
