# Game Jam

A game jam is a gathering of game developers for the purpose of planning, designing, and creating one or more games within a short span of time, usually ranging between 7 to 14 days. Game jams are a great way to challenge yourself, learn new skills, and collaborate with other developers.

## How Does a Game Jam Work?

The game jam process typically involves the following steps:
1. Theme Announcement
2. Development Phase
3. Submission Deadline
4. Judging and Awards

### Theme Announcement

At the beginning of the game jam, a theme or prompt is announced to all participants. This theme serves as the inspiration and constraint for the games created during the jam. Participants are encouraged to interpret the theme creatively and incorporate it into their game designs.

### Development Phase

After the theme is announced, participants have a limited amount of time to work on their games. This phase usually lasts between 7 to 14 days, depending on the duration of the game jam. During this time, developers work on designing, programming, and creating assets for their games.

### Submission Deadline

Once the development phase is complete, participants must submit their games before the deadline. Submissions typically include a playable version of the game, a description, and a game icon.

### Judging and Awards

All submissions are posted in a special category of the Highrise Worlds Directory for 1 week. During this time, the Highrise players act as our judges. The top 3 games with the highest number of hours will be the winners and receive exclusive rewards!

## Prizes and Awards

The top 3 winners of the game jam will receive the following prizes:

1. **üèÜ 1st Place**: 300.000 Earned gold
2. **ü•à 2nd Place**: 200.000 Earned gold
3. **ü•â 3rd Place**: 100.000 Earned gold

The top 3 games will also win a 1 month in the Spotlight section of the Highrise World directory.

## Rules and Guidelines

1. Worlds must be published and tagged with the provided tag name by the submission deadline.
2. Worlds must be created after the game jam theme announcement. Pre-existing worlds are disqualified.
3. You may use pre-existing code, art, and audio assets you have legal rights to use, but worlds made before the announcement cannot be reused.
4. Solo and group efforts are welcome. Teams of 2-4 people are recommended. Join the #studio-beta channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/highrise) to find teammates.
5. Participants must be **13 or older** to join.
6. Worlds must follow the [Highrise Community Guidelines](https://intercom.help/pocketworlds/en/articles/8043105-what-are-the-highrise-community-guidelines).
7. In-world gold/items giveaways are not allowed during the judging period.
