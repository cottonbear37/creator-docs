# Game Jam

A game jam is a gathering of game developers for the purpose of planning, designing, and creating one or more games within a short span of time, usually ranging between 7 to 14 days. Game jams are a great way to challenge yourself, learn new skills, and collaborate with other developers.

## How Does a Game Jam Work?

The game jam process typically involves the following steps:
1. Theme Announcement
2. Development Phase
3. Submission Deadline
4. Judging and Awards

### Theme Announcement

At the beginning of the game jam, a theme or prompt is announced to all participants. This theme serves as the inspiration and constraint for the games created during the jam. Participants are encouraged to interpret the theme creatively and incorporate it into their game designs.

### Development Phase

After the theme is announced, participants have a limited amount of time to work on their games. This phase usually lasts between 7 to 14 days, depending on the duration of the game jam. During this time, developers work on designing, programming, and creating assets for their games.

### Submission Deadline

Once the development phase is complete, participants must submit their games before the deadline. Submissions typically include a playable version of the game, a description, and any additional materials required for judging.

### Judging and Awards

After the submission deadline, games are evaluated by a panel of judges. The top worlds with the highest ratings and engagement are recognized and awarded prizes at the end of the game jam. Participants also have the opportunity to showcase their games to the community and receive feedback.

## Rules and Guidelines

1. Worlds must be published during the game jam period.
2. Game development should begin no sooner than the start of the game jam.
3. You may use pre-existing assets, but the majority of the game should be created during the jam.
4. Solo developers and group efforts are both allowed.
5. You must be **13 years or older** to participate.
6. Worlds must adhere to the [Highrise Community Guidelines](https://intercom.help/pocketworlds/en/articles/8043105-what-are-the-highrise-community-guidelines).
7. In-world gold/items giveaways are not allowed during the judging period.
8. Games must adhere to the theme announced at the start of the game jam.
9. Bug fixes and updates are allowed after the submission deadline.
10. If in team, gold prizes granted on a per team basis.

Rules and guidelines may vary depending on the specific game jam. Be sure to review the official rules and guidelines for the game jam you are participating in.
