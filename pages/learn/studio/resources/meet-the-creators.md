### Can you tell us about your journey as a 3D artist? How did you first become interested in creating within Highrise Studio?

Iâ€™ve always been passionate about building and creatingâ€”if a game has building features, Iâ€™m instantly hooked! When I learned we were moving towards Unity, which supports 3D building, I knew it was the perfect opportunity to dive in and grow my skills as a 3D modeler. Interestingly, I started at Pocket Worlds as a 2D artist, and now Iâ€™m fully immersed in 3D and Unity. Itâ€™s been an exciting evolution!

### How did you find the transition to using Unity? Were there any aspects of Unity that surprised you or felt different compared to other tools you've used?

The transition to Unity was smoother than I expected! Having teammates who were willing to answer questions was a huge help, but honestly, thereâ€™s a treasure trove of tutorials on YouTube that can walk you through just about anything. Itâ€™s such a versatile tool, and once you get the basics down, the possibilities feel limitless.

### What inspires your designs and creations within the Highrise world? Are there any themes or styles you particularly enjoy exploring?

I usually just let my imagination lead the way. Highrise Studio is like one big, open sandbox where you can turn any idea into reality. I especially enjoy creating worlds that explore space and the voidâ€”theyâ€™re themes that really spark my creativity and offer so much room for interpretation.

### For new artists curious about Highrise Studio, how has your experience been with the platform's ease of use? Has it helped you bring your ideas to life effectively?

Absolutely! Highrise Studio is incredibly intuitive and easy to learn. The basics outlined on the website https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/basics/overview are more than enough to help you build immersive and visually striking worlds.

### Is there a specific feature or tool in Highrise Studio that you feel really enhances creativity and makes the creation process enjoyable?

Highrise Studioâ€™s open-ended design makes it stand out. It allows creators to fully express their imagination without limitations.

### What advice would you give to someone new to Unity or 3D art who wants to create their first world?

Just dive in and start! Itâ€™s really that simple. Whether you want to design something cozy like a bedroom or go all out with a complex, game-like experience, the tools are there to support your vision.

### In your opinion, what makes Highrise Studio a good platform for beginners starting their creative journey?

The platform offers so many resources to guide you every step of the way. Highriseâ€™s tutorials and learning pages make it easy to grasp the fundamentals, and thereâ€™s a welcoming community of creators to draw inspiration from.

### How has being part of the Highrise community influenced your work? Do you enjoy sharing your creations with players and other creators?

Sharing my creations with players is one of the best parts of the process! Seeing their excitement and hearing their appreciation for the details Iâ€™ve added makes all the hard work worth it.

### How do you hope your work will inspire others in the Highrise community? Do you have any tips for getting visibility for oneâ€™s creations?

I hope my work shows others that there are no limits to what they can create. As for visibility, focus on crafting unique, high-quality worlds, and share your creations enthusiastically with the community. People are drawn to passion and originality!

### Are there any new projects or ideas you're currently working on that youâ€™re excited to share? Whatâ€™s next for you creatively?

Right now, Iâ€™m busy working on official events and game worlds for Highrise. Itâ€™s exciting to create fun, engaging spaces for our players. In the future, Iâ€™d love to develop an entire Void-themed metaverse within Highriseâ€”itâ€™s a big dream, but Iâ€™m confident itâ€™ll happen someday!

## Where do you think the future of virtual world creation is heading, and how do you see Highrise Studio fitting into that vision?

The future is all about empowering players to bring their own creativity to life. Highrise Studio is already a leader in making that process as simple and accessible as possible. As we continue to grow and innovate, weâ€™re not just building tools and resourcesâ€”weâ€™re building them together with our community. Every step we take is shaped by feedback and collaboration with the creators who use the platform, ensuring that weâ€™re all part of this journey to bring dream worlds to life in entirely new and exciting ways.
