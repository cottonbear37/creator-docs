### Can you tell us about yourself and how you got started with virtual world building?

Hi, my name is HernÃ¡n. I currently work independently creating small video games for web portals. I use event-based programming, which allows me to design game logic without writing traditional code. When I arrived at Highrise, I was intrigued by the bots and started experimenting with traditional programming, which was really fun. But when worlds were introduced, it was like discovering an even more exciting new toy! That's when my journey into world creation began

### What inspired you to create your virtual world in Highrise?

Pac Mania was inspired by classic arcade games. I enjoy creating video games, so I wanted to build a playable experience within Highrise where people can use their avatars as the main character, as if they were inside a video game. On top of that, the multiplayer experience makes it even more fun!

### Can you describe the theme or concept behind your world?

Pac Mania is a small video game where you have to collect orbs while dodging ghosts that are trying to catch you. You must strive to get the highest score and make it onto the leaderboard. If the first level seems too easy, there are still 4 extra difficulty levels that will challenge your skills.

### What sets your world apart from others in Highrise?

Although there are other small games within Highrise, Pac Mania is unique in its genre. Its design and gameplay are something you wonâ€™t find in any other world. Plus, I plan to improve it even more over time, so donâ€™t miss out on the updates!

### Is there a world made by another creator that you really love? What do you look for in other people's world experiences?

Even though NautisShadrick is part of the staff, I love the worlds he has created. I think they set the standard for the quality and aesthetics we should aspire to, showing creators the true potential that worlds have. I also love Twilight Prancer by SpillyMillyâ€”you can ride your own reindeer while jumping across platforms, and the reindeer is just too cute!
What I look for in worlds are unique experiences that stand out from the rest. It doesn't need to be something huge; being creative is enough!

### How do you approach designing and building within the virtual environment?

The first thing I do is lay out the tools I have, like checkpoint systems, jumping, teleporting, leaderboards, collecting coins, etc. My world is created using tools offered by Highrise in its catalog and code shared by other creators. Then, I look for ideas within those limits and choose the one I like the most. After that, I look for the assets. Nowadays, there are assets for almost anything you can imagine, so thatâ€™s usually not a problem. In my previous worlds, I didnâ€™t touch a single line of code, but in this one, I wanted to go further and modified what I had to give it a unique touch, like having multiple leaderboards at the same time and turning the ghosts blue. It was truly a challenge, but the result was worth it.

### What do you hope players will experience or take away from exploring your world?

I hope people have fun whether they play alone or with their friends, challenging each other to see who gets the highest score. It's so much fun to play with your friend and see how they just got caught by a ghost while you're still fighting to survive haha. Also, from time to time, Iâ€™ll be holding contests to reward the best players!

### What advice would you give to players who want to start creating worlds?

Learn little by little and participate in Gamejams, even if at the beginning you can only add assets to your world and it doesnâ€™t contain anything extraordinary. Each Gamejam offers something new to learn, like I said beforeâ€”jumping, checkpoints, obstacles, etc. Every small piece of knowledge will add up, and over time youâ€™ll be able to create something more and more interesting!

### Are there any unique features or hidden gems within your world that players should look out for?

I think it's hard to notice, but the ghosts in some maps don't move completely randomly. Some have fixed zones, while others move all over the place. Maybe if you pay attention to this, it could help you get a better score!

### How do you engage with the Highrise community to promote your world?

Promoting worlds is usually quite difficult because there are so many things to do within Highrise and more and more worlds being created. However, we creators have a tool to promote our worlds through ads. I use this, and it helps get your world known by users. If your world is really good, you won't need to use it anymore because it will grow through word of mouth!

## What challenges have you both faced during the creation process, and how did you overcome them?

I faced many challenges because this world was quite ambitious, and I wanted to explore things I had never done before. Most of these challenges may seem like minor details, but they weren't easy to solve. If you play Pac Mania, youâ€™ll notice a sound when you collect an orb. These orbs are very close to each other, and if the sound played every time one is collected, the sounds would overlap, creating an unpleasant noise. So, I came up with a system where the sounds queue up in order, making the experience of collecting orbs sound very pleasant! I want to thank Azalearei and iHsein, who are always willing to help creators with their questions!

### What do you think users will find most exciting about creating their first world?

Even though in your first world you'll be worried about removing that strange shadow stain on the ground (you need to create your first world to understand this reference), I think it can be really exciting to realize the amazing things you can do with worlds. I see many people asking, 'Is it possible to do this in the world? Can you do that?' The answer is usually YES. You can really create almost anything in the worlds. The current worlds are just a small glimpse of what's coming in the future.

### Lastly, do you have any upcoming projects or plans for the future you would like to share with us?

I have many ideas, really. Even though I really enjoy mini-games within worlds, I'm also aware that people are on Highrise because it's a fashion game, and they love being able to get items to dress up their avatars. I'd also like to create worlds that help the community and serve as useful tools for players, but I wonâ€™t stop making the occasional game!

### Thank you for sharing your insights with us, XhernanX We can't wait to see what you create next. ðŸŒŸ
