# **Importing a World**

## **Introduction**
Looking to craft your first immersive, virtual world? You're in the right place at the right time! Let's dive into the process of using Studio Hub to generate, illuminate, and test your inaugural creation. It's easier than you think and a lot more fun!

### **Importing a World**
1. Setup Studio Hub and the necessary Unity plugins.
2. Open Studio Hub.
3. Click "Open Project" and navigate to the folder of the World you want to import. This will open the World in Unity.

== Note Unity doesnt auto open the scene when launching a World for the first time ==
== Tip - You can filter the project window by type. Ex, t:scene will only show scenes. ==

4. Open the main scene for the World by finding it in the Project Tab in Unity.
