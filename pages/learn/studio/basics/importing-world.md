# Importing a World

## Introduction

This guide details the steps to import an existing world to Highrise Studio. You can make changes, test in Play mode, and publish the world after import.

## Steps to Import a World

### Set Up Environment

1. Install Studio Hub and necessary Unity plugins.

### Open Project

1. Launch Studio Hub.
2. Use "Open Project" to find and select the world's folder. This action will load the world in Unity.

   **Note:** Unity doesn't automatically open the scene when you launch a world for the first time.
   
   **Tip:** Use `t:scene` in the project window to filter and display only scene files.

### Open Main Scene

1. Locate the main scene in Unity's Project Tab and open it.
