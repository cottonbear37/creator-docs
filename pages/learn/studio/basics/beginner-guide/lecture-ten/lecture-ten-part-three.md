# Part 3: Shadows

## Introduction

Shadows help make your game look more realistic by giving depth to objects. This section will show you how to turn on and adjust shadows in your game.

## Enabling Shadows

To get shadows working, you need to change settings for both the light sources and the objects in your game. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Enable Shadows for Light Sources

1. Choose the light source that will cast shadows.
2. In the Inspector window, select the **Shadow Type** option.
3. Pick either **Hard Shadows** or **Soft Shadows** depending on what you need.

<Note type="warning">
Hard shadows are clear and sharp but might slow down your game. Soft shadows look smoother but can also take up more resources.
</Note>

## Important Note

Make sure you turn on shadows for objects that need them and set up your light sources correctly to get the look you want.

Change the position and direction of the directional light to see how shadows move with the light. Try different shadow types and settings to find the best balance between how your game looks and how well it runs.
