# Highrise UI Specification Overview

## Introduction

This document outlines the specifications for creating user interfaces (UI) in Highrise worlds. It serves as a guideline for creators to ensure consistency, usability, and performance across different game interfaces built on the Highrise platform.

## Design Principles

### Consistency
- **Visual Harmony**: All UI elements should follow a unified theme with consistent color schemes, fonts, and iconography.
- **Functional Consistency**: Similar functions should be represented in similar ways across different parts of the game.

### Usability
- **Intuitiveness**: UI should be straightforward and easy to navigate.
- **Feedback**: Immediate feedback must be provided for user actions to confirm interactions.
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure high contrast between text and background colors.

## Performance Optimization

- **Asset Management**: Minimize the size of UI assets to reduce load times.
- **Script Efficiency**: Optimize Lua scripts to minimize CPU load.
