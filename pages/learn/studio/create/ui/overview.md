# Highrise Studio UI Documentation

## User Interface (UI) Overview
Highrise Studio uses **Unity Extensible Markup Language (UXML)** files to define the user interface (UI) for your projects.

### What is UXML?
**UXML** is a declarative markup language similar to HTML, but designed specifically for Unity. You use it to define the structure of your UI. Then, you style your UI using **Unity Style Sheets (USS)** and add functionality with **Lua**.

## Creating a UI
1. Go to the **Project** panel.
2. Right-click and create a new folder for organization.
3. Name the folder appropriately.
4. Inside the folder, right-click and select **Create**.
5. Choose **Lua** > **UI**.
6. Give your UI a name using all lowercase letters to avoid issues with class names when styling.

## Attaching UI to a GameObject
- UIs in Unity function like any **GameObject**, requiring a GameObject to be present in the scene.
- To add a UI to your scene:
  1. Go to the **Hierarchy**, right-click, and select **Create Empty**.
  2. Name this empty GameObject.
  3. Select the created GameObject, locate your UI file in the **Project** panel, and drag it onto the GameObject in the **Inspector** to attach it as a component.

### UI Output Options
- **None**: The UI will not be displayed.
- **World**: The UI acts as a 3D world object, useful for elements like billboards, player names, or leaderboards.
- **Above Chat**: The UI moves with the chat window, ensuring itâ€™s not hidden behind chat messages, useful for buttons and other interactive elements.
- **HUD**: The UI is overlaid on the screen and can appear anywhere, typically used for heads-up displays.

## Overview of UXML, USS, and Lua
- **UXML**: Used to construct the UI, defining what elements are included, like player lists or other interface components.
- **USS**: Used for styling the UI, allowing you to customize fonts, images, and overall appearance.
- **Lua**: Handles functionality, like making buttons work or dynamically creating UXML elements based on game data.

## Conclusion

Highrise Studio uses UXML to define the structure of your UI, USS to style it, and Lua to add functionality. By creating a UI, attaching it to a GameObject, and choosing the appropriate output option, you can create a visually appealing and interactive interface for your project.
