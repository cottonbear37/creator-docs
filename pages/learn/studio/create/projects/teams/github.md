# What is GitHub?

GitHub is an online platform that helps individuals and teams store, manage, and track changes to their programming projects. It uses Git, a version control system that allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's contributions.

## How Does GitHub Help in Collaboration?

GitHub simplifies collaboration on projects through several key features:

### 1. Repositories (Repos)

- A repository is like a project folder on GitHub. It contains all project files and records all changes made to them.

### 2. Branches

- Each repository can have multiple branches. A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main project (usually called the "main" branch). It allows independent work on changes, which can later be merged back into the main project.

### 3. Commits

- A commit is like a "save" point in a project's history. Each commit is a snapshot of changes, which can be revisited or restored if needed.

### 4. Pull Requests (PRs)

- A pull request is used to merge changes from one branch to the main branch. This allows team members to review and discuss changes before they are integrated into the main project.

### 5. Merges

- Merging incorporates changes from one branch (like a personal branch) into another (typically the main branch). This finalizes the addition of individual work to the overall project.

## Steps to Use GitHub for Collaboration

### Step 1: Set Up GitHub Account

- Sign up at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/). It's free for basic use and offers unlimited public repositories.

### Step 2: Create New Repository

- Click the "+" icon in the upper right corner of the GitHub homepage and select "New repository."
- Name the repository, decide if it's public or private, and initialize it with a README.

### Step 3: Invite Collaborators

- Navigate to repository settings, click "Manage access," then "Invite collaborators." Enter their GitHub usernames to give them access.

### Step 4: Start Making Changes

- Create branches to work on updates or new features. Edit files directly on GitHub or use Git locally to sync changes.

### Step 5: Open Pull Requests

- Once changes are ready and pushed to GitHub, open a pull request. This lets others review changes, provide feedback, and suggest improvements.

### Step 6: Merge Changes

- After review, merge the pull request to incorporate changes into the main branch, updating the project with contributions.

### Step 7: Pull Latest Changes

- Regularly pull the latest changes from GitHub to the local project to keep it up-to-date, especially if multiple people are contributing.

GitHub streamlines collaboration by making it easier to track changes, work together from anywhere, and maintain a clean, organized workflow. Whether coding, creating documents, or managing non-technical projects, GitHub provides the tools needed for efficient teamwork.
