# Characters

## Introduction
**Characters** typically refer to any `Model` objects that represent a character in your game. This could be a player character, an NPC, or even an enemy.

Characters can range between **basic** characters, which are simple non-player characters (NPCs) that don't have any special behavior, to **avatar** characters, which are player characters that can be controlled by the player.
