# Lecture 10: Lighting Basics

## Introduction

Lighting is key to making your game look great and feel real. It helps set the mood, highlight key parts of your game, and guide players. In this lecture, we'll go over the basics of using lighting in Highrise Studio to improve your game's visuals.

## Key Concepts

Here are the main lighting concepts we'll cover, each linked to a specific part of the lecture for more detailed learning:

1. **[Environment Lighting](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/beginner-guide/lecture-ten/lecture-ten-part-one)** - Controls the general lighting of your scene.
2. **[Light Sources](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/beginner-guide/lecture-ten/lecture-ten-part-two)** - Adds lights to your game world.
3. **[Shadows](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/beginner-guide/lecture-ten/lecture-ten-part-three)** - Gives depth to your scene with realistic shadows.
4. **[Bake Lighting](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/beginner-guide/lecture-ten/lecture-ten-part-four)** - Saves computer resources by optimizing lights.
5. **[Post-Processing Effects](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/beginner-guide/lecture-ten/lecture-ten-part-five)** - Enhances your scene with special visual effects.

## Supported Light Modes

Highrise Studio currently supports only **Baked** lighting, meaning all lights need to be pre-calculated and saved (baked) into your scene before playing. Real-time lighting isn’t available in this version.

Don’t worry if this sounds complex! We'll explain more about how to effectively use baked lighting in the following sections.
