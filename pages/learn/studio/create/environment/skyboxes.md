# Skyboxes

Skyboxes are a way to add a background to your scene. They are a cube with a texture on each face, and the camera is always at the center of the cube. This creates the illusion of a background that is infinitely far away.

## Importance

Skyboxes are essential for creating immersive environments. They provide a backdrop for your scene and can set the mood and atmosphere. Skyboxes can be used to create realistic outdoor environments, space scenes, and more.

## Benefits of Skyboxes

- **Immersive Environments**: Enhance realism and immersion.
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Create diverse lighting and weather effects.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize scene performance.
- **Easy Integration**: Effortlessly add to your scene.
