# Lighting

Lighting is an essential aspect of creating realistic and visually appealing scenes in Unity. By using lights effectively, you can enhance the mood, atmosphere, and overall quality of your project. In this guide, you will learn about the different types of lights available in Unity, how to access and configure lights in your scene, and various lighting techniques you can use to achieve the desired visual effects.

## Types of Lights

Unity provides several types of lights that you can use to illuminate your scene. Each type of light has unique properties and can be used to achieve different lighting effects. Here are some of the most common types of lights in Unity:

- [Directional Light](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/environment/lighting/types-of-light/directional-light) - Emits light in a specific direction, akin to sunlight.
- [Point Light](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/environment/lighting/types-of-light/point-light) - Emits light in all directions from a single point in space.
- [Spotlight](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/environment/lighting/types-of-light/spotlight) - Projects light in a cone-shaped direction.
- [Area Light](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/environment/lighting/types-of-light/area-light) - Emits light from a rectangular or circular area. 

Each type of light has its unique characteristics and can be used to create different lighting effects in your scene. Experiment with different lights to achieve the desired look and feel for your project.

## Accessing Lights

To access lights in Unity, you can use the Lighting window, which provides a visual interface for managing lights in your scene. You can access the Lighting window by going to `Window > Rendering > Lighting` in the Unity Editor or `CTRL + 9`. In the Lighting window, you can adjust various lighting settings, including light types, intensity, color, and range.

## Baking Lightmaps

Lightmaps are a way to simulate global illumination in a scene. They are a precomputed texture that stores the lighting information for a scene. This allows for more realistic lighting in a scene without the need for real-time calculations.

## Light Properties

Lights in Unity have various properties that you can adjust to control their appearance and behavior. Some of the most common properties of lights include:

- **Intensity**: Controls the brightness of the light.
- **Color**: Specifies the color of the light.
- **Range**: Determines how far the light reaches.

By adjusting these properties, you can customize the appearance of lights in your scene and create the desired lighting effects. Experiment with different settings to achieve the look you want for your project.

## Lighting Techniques

In addition to using different types of lights, you can also employ various lighting techniques to enhance the visual quality of your scene. Some common lighting techniques include:

- **Ambient Occlusion**: Simulates the soft shadows that occur in real-world environments.
- **Global Illumination**: Models the indirect lighting that bounces off surfaces in the scene.
- **Reflections**: Adds reflective surfaces to create realistic reflections of objects and lights.
- **Light Probes**: Captures the lighting information at specific points in the scene for more accurate lighting effects.

By combining different lighting techniques, you can create visually stunning scenes that are realistic and immersive. Experiment with different lighting setups and techniques to achieve the desired visual effects for your project.

## Different Lighting Types

In the table below, we summarize the different types of lights available in Unity, along with their descriptions and use cases:

| Light Type      | Description                                                                                   | Use Case                                                                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Directional Light | Emits light in a specific direction, akin to sunlight.                                           | Simulating sunlight in outdoor scenes, providing uniform lighting across the entire scene. |
| Point Light       | Emits light in all directions from a single point in space.                                      | Creating localized light sources, such as lamps or light bulbs.                             |
| Spotlight         | Projects light in a cone-shaped direction.                                                      | Focusing light on specific areas or objects in the scene.                                   |
| Area Light        | Emits light from a rectangular or circular area.                                                 | Simulating light sources with a larger surface area, such as windows or skylights.          |

Each type of light has its unique characteristics and can be used to achieve different lighting effects in your scene. By understanding the properties and use cases of each light type, you can effectively illuminate your scene and create visually appealing environments in Unity.
