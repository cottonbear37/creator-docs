# Area Light

An **Area Light** is a type of light source that emits light from a rectangular or circular area. It is commonly used to simulate light sources with a larger surface area, such as windows, skylights, or other architectural features. In this guide, you will learn how to create and configure an Area Light in Unity to illuminate your scene effectively.

## Creating an Area Light

To create an Area Light in Unity, follow these steps:

1. Open the Unity Editor and create a new scene or open an existing scene.
2. Go to `GameObject > Light > Area Light` in the Unity Editor's menu bar.
3. An Area Light object will be created in your scene, emitting light from a rectangular or circular area.

## Configuring an Area Light

Once you have created an Area Light in your scene, you can configure its properties to achieve the desired lighting effects. Some of the key properties of an Area Light that you can adjust include:

- **General Settings**:
  - **Type**: Specifies the type of light source (Area Light).
  - **Mode**: Determines how the light interacts with objects in the scene (Realtime or Baked).

- **Emission**:
  - **Color**: Specifies the color of the light emitted by the Area Light.
  - **Intensity**: Controls the brightness of the light.
  - **Range**: Determines how far the light reaches.
  - **Shape**: Specifies the shape of the area light (Rectangle or Disc).

- **Rendering**:
  - **Render Mode**: Determines how the light is rendered (Auto, Important, or Not Important).
  - **Culling Mask**: Specifies which layers the light affects.

- **Shadows**:
  - **Shadow Type**: Specifies the type of shadows cast by the light (Hard Shadows, Soft Shadows, or No Shadows).

By adjusting these properties, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the Area Light in your scene. Experiment with different settings to achieve the desired lighting effects and create visually stunning scenes.

## Using Area Light in Your Scene

An Area Light is commonly used to simulate light sources with a larger surface area, such as windows, skylights, or other architectural features. By positioning the Area Light at specific locations and adjusting the shape, intensity, and range, you can create realistic lighting effects that enhance the mood and atmosphere of the environment. You can also adjust the color, shape, and other properties of the Area Light to achieve different lighting effects and create visually appealing scenes.

In addition to simulating architectural lighting, an Area Light can also be used to create special lighting effects, such as soft shadows, ambient lighting, or volumetric lighting. Experiment with different configurations and settings to achieve the desired look and feel for your project.

## Area Light Positioning Tips

When positioning an Area Light in your scene, consider the following tips:

- **Location**: Position the Area Light at the center of the area you want to illuminate. Experiment with different locations to achieve the desired lighting effects.

- **Shape**: Adjust the shape of the Area Light to control the spread of light. Rectangular shapes create more directional lighting, while circular shapes create more diffuse lighting.

- **Intensity**: Control the intensity of the Area Light to adjust the brightness of the light. Higher intensities create brighter lighting effects, while lower intensities create softer lighting.

- **Color**: Adjust the color of the Area Light to create different lighting effects. For example, warm colors like yellow and orange can create a cozy, inviting atmosphere, while cool colors like blue and green can create a calming, serene effect.

By following these tips and experimenting with different configurations, you can effectively use an Area Light to illuminate your scene and create visually stunning environments in Unity.

## Conclusion

An Area Light is a versatile tool for simulating light sources with a larger surface area and creating realistic lighting effects in Unity. By adjusting the properties and configurations of the Area Light, you can achieve different lighting effects and enhance the mood and atmosphere of your project. Experiment with different settings and configurations to create visually stunning scenes that captivate your audience.
