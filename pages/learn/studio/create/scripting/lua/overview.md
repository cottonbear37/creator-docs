# Lua

## Introduction

Lua is a lightweight, high-level scripting language designed for embedded systems and game development. It is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration with other programming languages. In Highrise Studio, Lua is the primary scripting language used to create interactive gameplay, define behaviors, and customize game elements.

## Support in Highrise Studio

In Highise Studio, Lua is used to script game logic, create interactive experiences, and enhance the functionality of your Highrise world. You can write Lua scripts to control game objects, handle player input, manage game states, and implement custom behaviors. Lua scripts are executed within the Highrise runtime environment, allowing you to interact with the game world and respond to events in real-time.

> You cannot use C# scripts in Highrise Studio. Lua is the only supported scripting language for creating games and experiences on the Highrise platform.
