# Scripting

Scripting is a powerful tool that allows you to create custom behaviors and interactions in your Studio projects. You can use scripting to create custom animations, control the behavior of objects, and even create mini-games.

# Language Support

Highrise Studio supports scripting in [Lua](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/scripting/lua/overview) which is a lightweight, high-level scripting language designed for embedded systems and game development. Lua is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration with other programming languages.

# Scripting in Highrise Studio

In Highrise Studio, scripting is used to define game logic, create interactive experiences, and enhance the functionality of your Highrise world. You can write scripts to control game objects, handle player input, manage game states, and implement custom behaviors. Scripts are executed within the Highrise runtime environment, allowing you to interact with the game world and respond to events in real-time.
