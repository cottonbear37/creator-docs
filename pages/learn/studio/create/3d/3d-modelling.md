# **3D Modelling**

## **Introduction**
3D Modelling assets and props is essential for building virtual environments in video games, animations, and other digital media. These are digital representations of objects like furniture, vehicles, and creatures, created using 3D Modelling software.

## **How Does It Work?**
To populate a scene, you use 3D Modelling software to create digital objects. These objects, crafted from polygons, are textured and shaped to mimic real-world and/or fantastical objects. They can then be animated and added to various scenes to enhance the visual experience.
