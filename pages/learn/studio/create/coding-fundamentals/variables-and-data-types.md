# Variables and Data Types

## Introduction

[Variables](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/scripting/lua/features/variables) and data types are foundational concepts in programming that enable you to work with different types of information in your scripts. By understanding how to declare variables and use common data types, you can create dynamic and interactive behavior in your Highrise worlds. Experiment with different data types and explore their capabilities to enhance your scripting skills and develop engaging gameplay experiences.

## What Are Variables?

In programming, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value or data. Variables allow you to store information temporarily and reference it throughout your script. By assigning values to variables, you can create dynamic and interactive behavior in your Highrise worlds. Variables can store various types of data, such as numbers, strings, and objects, depending on their data type.

## Usage of Variables

Variables are essential for managing data and controlling the flow of code execution in your scripts. By using variables, you can store player scores, track game progress, manage character attributes, and create interactive elements in your Highrise worlds. Variables enable you to work with dynamic data and respond to changing conditions, making your scripts more engaging and immersive.

## Data Types in Lua

Data types define the kind of information that variables can store. In Lua, variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, booleans, tables, and functions. Understanding data types is crucial for working with variables effectively and ensuring that your scripts behave as expected. By using the appropriate data types, you can manipulate data accurately and create complex interactions in your Highrise worlds.

## Common Data Types in Lua

Here are some common data types in Lua that you'll encounter when working with variables:

- [numbers](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/scripting/lua/types/numbers): Represent numerical values, such as integers and floating-point numbers.
- [strings](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/scripting/lua/types/strings): Represent sequences of characters enclosed in quotation marks.
- [booleans](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/scripting/lua/types/booleans): Represent logical values `true` or `false`.
- [tables](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/scripting/lua/types/tables): Represent collections of key-value pairs that store structured data.
- [nil](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/scripting/lua/types/nil): Represents the absence of a value or uninitialized variables.
- [functions](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/create/scripting/lua/features/functions): Represent blocks of code that perform specific tasks when called.
