# Functions

## Introduction

Functions are code blocks that perform specific tasks when called. They help organize your code, reduce redundancy, and improve readability. Understanding functions is essential for creating modular and maintainable scripts in your Highrise world.

## Defining Functions

In Lua, you can define functions using the `function` keyword followed by the function name and parameters.

## Scope of Functions

Functions in Lua have their own scope, meaning they can access variables defined within their scope or passed as parameters. Local variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function.

## Calling Functions

You can call a function by using its name followed by parentheses `()`. If the function requires parameters, you can pass them inside the parentheses.

## Returning Values

Functions can return values to the caller using the `return` statement. You can specify the return values after the `return` keyword.

## Benefits of Functions

Functions help you break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts. By encapsulating code in functions, you can reuse it across your scripts, improve code organization, and enhance the maintainability of your Highrise world.

## Conclusion

Functions are fundamental building blocks in Lua scripting that enable you to encapsulate code, improve code organization, and enhance the maintainability of your Highrise projects. By mastering functions and understanding how to define, call, and return values from functions, you can create modular and reusable code that powers dynamic and interactive gameplay experiences in your Highrise world. Experiment with functions, explore different use cases, and apply best practices to elevate your Lua scripting skills and develop engaging content in Highrise Studio.
