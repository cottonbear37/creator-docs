# Retention

## Introduction

**Retention** is a key performance indicator (KPI) that measures how many players return to your game over time. It provides crucial insights into the game's appeal and its ability to keep players engaged. This comprehensive guide explains how to access, interpret, and utilize retention metrics to enhance your game development strategies.

## Viewing Retention Metrics

To access retention metrics for your game:

1. Navigate to the **[Creation Tab](https://create.highrise.game/dashboard/creations)** in the Creator Portal.
2. Open the world you want to analyze.
3. Go to the **Analytics** tab.
4. Click on the **Retention** tab.

## Understanding Retention Metrics

### Types of Retention Metrics

The **Retention** tab displays various metrics, each providing insights into different aspects of player behavior:

- **Day 1 Retention**: Percentage of players returning the day after their first session.
- **Day 3 Retention**: Indicates return on the third day.
- **Day 7, Day 14, Day 30 Retention**: Longer-term retention metrics that gauge the sustained appeal of your game.

### Analyzing the Total Retention Curve

- **Total Retention**: Shows the percentage of new players who played again on subsequent days.
- **Trends and Patterns**: A consistent upward trend suggests good player engagement, while sharp declines may indicate underlying issues, such as unengaging content or technical problems.

Understanding one retention metric can help you understand others. For example, if Day 1 Retention is low, it may impact longer-term retention metrics as well.

## Enhancing Game Retention

### Improving Onboarding

Optimize your tutorial to make initial learning engaging and straightforward. Ensure that the first experiences in your game are rewarding and memorable to foster early player commitment.

### Content and Updates

Regularly introduce new content and updates to keep the game fresh and engaging. Consider time-limited events or special challenges to encourage regular log-ins.

### Community and Feedback

Build a robust community around your game to enhance player loyalty. Implement in-game feedback tools to gather direct player inputs, which can guide your development efforts.

### Predictive Analytics

Use predictive models to anticipate player behaviors, customize player experiences, and intervene proactively to improve retention.

## Case Studies

Include case studies from successful games to illustrate effective retention strategies. Discuss what strategies were implemented, their impacts, and how other developers can apply these insights.

## Conclusion

Effectively tracking and improving player retention transcends mere numbersâ€”it involves creating a compelling, enjoyable, and evolving gaming experience that keeps players returning. By rigorously analyzing retention metrics and integrating player feedback into development, you can significantly enhance both player satisfaction and your game's longevity.
