# Publishing Your Asset

The [Highrise Asset Catalog](/learn/studio/create/assets/highrise-catalog) allows creators to upload custom assets, including objects, models, and scripts, to share with the community. This guide elucidates the process of uploading assets to the Highrise Asset Catalog, enabling creators to contribute to the growing collection of resources available to Highrise creators.

## Creating Custom Assets

Before uploading assets to the Highrise Asset Catalog, creators must first create custom assets within Unity. This process involves designing and developing objects, models, scripts, or other resources that can be shared with the community. Creators can leverage their creativity and expertise to craft unique assets that enhance the Highrise experience for players.

Assets are typically created using Unity's built-in tools or third-party software, such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Creators can design 3D models, textures, animations,  and scripts to bring their vision to life within the Highrise platform.
