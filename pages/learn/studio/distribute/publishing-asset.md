# Publishing Your Asset

The [Highrise Asset Catalog](/learn/studio/create/assets/highrise-catalog) allows creators to upload custom assets, including objects, models, and scripts, to share with the community. This guide elucidates the process of uploading assets to the Highrise Asset Catalog, enabling creators to contribute to the growing collection of resources available to Highrise creators.

## Creating Custom Assets

Before uploading assets to the Highrise Asset Catalog, creators must first create custom assets within Unity. This process involves designing and developing objects, models, scripts, or other resources that can be shared with the community. Creators can leverage their creativity and expertise to craft unique assets that enhance the Highrise experience for players.

Assets are typically created using Unity's built-in tools or third-party software, such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Creators can design 3D models, textures, animations,  and scripts to bring their vision to life within the Highrise platform.

To build more engaging and interactive experiences, creators can enhance their projects by combining multiple assets. For example, instead of merely uploading a chair, they could include anchors or additional elements that complement the primary asset.

## Pricing Your Asset

You can price your asset by setting the Gold price for the asset. Players can purchase your asset using Gold, Highrise will take 30% of the revenue generated from the sale of the asset, and the remaining 70% will be credited to your account as Earned Gold.

You cannot edit your asset once it is published. You can contact the support team directly in your asset group with HRCreate in the app if you need to make changes to your asset.
