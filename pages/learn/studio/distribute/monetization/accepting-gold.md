# Accepting Gold Payments

## Introduction

Highrise enables World Creators to accept Gold payments within their experiences.

## Revenue Share

Creators earn 70% of the Gold they collect. This is deposited directly into their [Creator Exchange](https://create.highrise.game/dashboard/finances/creator-exchange) as Earned Gold. The Highrise platform keeps 30% of the fee in order to pay for app store transaction fees, hosting fees, and continued platform development.

## How Accepting Gold Payments Works

This feature is not yet live. Look for a release of Highrise Studio with Payments API functionality soon.
