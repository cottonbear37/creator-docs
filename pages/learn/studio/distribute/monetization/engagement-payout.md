# Engagement-Based Payouts

## Introduction

As a World or Room Creator in Highrise, you can obtain Earned Gold when you create fun and engaging experiences. This Earned Gold can then be converted to cash in the [Creator Exchange](https://create.highrise.game/dashboard/finances/creator-exchange) once you have amassed a minimum of 35,000 Earned Gold.

## How Engagement-Based Payouts Work

Engagement-Based Payouts are settled daily based on how much time Highrise+ Subscribed users spend in your World or room. You can find data on how many Highrise+ users spent time in your experience and how much Earned Gold you received in the [Creations section](https://create.highrise.game/dashboard/creations) of your Creator Dashboard.

### Engagement-Based Payouts for Worlds

In order to receive engagement-based payouts for your World, your World must:

- Maintain a rating of 50%+.
- Engage at least 1 Highrise+ subscriber in the day (other than yourself).

### Engagement-Based Payouts for Rooms

In order to receive engagement-based payouts for your Room, your Room must:

- Engage at least 1 Highrise+ subscriber in the day (other than yourself).
- Receive sum of at least 50 visitors over the course of 24 hours. These must be unique visitors, though they don't all have to present in the room at the same time.
- Receive a minimum of 2.5 hours of total playtime from all users.
- Be owned by you. Crew rooms are not eligible for monetization.

## Receiving Earned Gold

If your World or Room qualifies, you will receive Earned Gold in your in-game Inbox the following day. Once you collect the Earned Gold from your Inbox, it will appear in your [Creator Exchange](https://create.highrise.game/dashboard/finances/creator-exchange). You are welcome to use the Earned Gold as regular Gold in-game, or wait until you have 35,000 Earned Gold in order to cash out.
