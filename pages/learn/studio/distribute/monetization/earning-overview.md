# Earning on Highrise

## Introduction

Highrise is a platform that rewards Creators for building fun and engaging experiences. Creators can earn in two ways: Engagement-Based Payouts that are paid out by Highrise daily, and the Payments API that allows Creators to charge Earned Gold for content inside their experiences.

## The Creator Exchange

Highrise pays Creators in the form of Earned Gold. Earned Gold can be spent in-game as regular Gold, or it can be cashed out in the [Creator Exchange](https://create.highrise.game/dashboard/finances/creator-exchange). Once you earn 35,000 Earned Gold or more, you are eligible to convert your virtual earnings to real-world cash. You can always check your Earned Gold balance directly in your [Creator Exchange Dashboard](https://create.highrise.game/dashboard/finances/creator-exchange).

## Engagement-Based Payouts

Worlds and rooms receive Engagement-Based Payouts based on how much time Highrise users spend in your world. These payments are settled daily and all Creators are paid automatically.

## Accepting Gold Payments

World Creators can accept Gold payments inside their experiences using the Payments API. This is not yet live, but is coming very soon.
