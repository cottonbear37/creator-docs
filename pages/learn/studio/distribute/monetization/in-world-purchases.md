# In-World Purchases (IWP)

## Introduction

In-World Purchases (IWP) are a way for World Creators to monetize their worlds by offering exclusive items, access to special areas, or other benefits in exchange for Gold.

## Revenue Share

Creators earn 70% of the Gold they collect from In-World Purchases. This is deposited directly into their [Creator Exchange](https://create.highrise.game/dashboard/finances/creator-exchange) as Earned Gold. Or you can enable IWP earnings to be deposited directly into your [World Wallet](https://create.highrise.game/learn/studio/distribute/monetization/world-wallet).
