You can deposit budget into your campaign by clicking on the **Deposit** button. The budget will be used to pay for the advertisement based on the Cost per 1000 Impressions (CPM) price.

## Campaign Budget Tips

- Gold added to the budget will be immediately taken from your Wallet.
- Ad Credits will be spent first before Gold.
- More Gold can be added later.
- Gold can only be withdrawn when campaign is disabled.
